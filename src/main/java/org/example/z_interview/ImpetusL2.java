        // Q1. tell me about your role and contribution to project.
        // Q2. explain your project architecture and tech stacks you have worked on.
        // Q3. any microservices architecture you are aware of?
        // Q4. explain microservices design pattern you have used or you are aware of?
        // Q5. explain java design pattern you have used or aware of?
        // Q6. explain domain driven architecture.
        // Q7. what is CQRS design pattern.
        // Q8. what is event driven architecture.
        // Q9. how microservices communicates with each other?
        // Q10. let's say you have web service api, and it is bombarded with request, and you have bot attack or DDOS attack, how you handle it
        // Q11. how you will make your microservices fault-tolerant and high availability?
        // Q12. explain circuit design pattern?
        // Q13. what is stack and heap memory
        // Q14. what is the diff b/w iterator and streams
        // Q15. what is the diff b/w collection and streams
        // Q16. what are the features of java8.
        // Q17. what is the diff b/w synchronized collection and concurrent collections.
        // Q18. how will you handle distributed microservice architecture?
        // Q19. how you will handle distributed txn in distributed microservice env.
        // Q20. you have singleton design pattern, if you make static instance then what happen and what;s the behaviour. and similarly if it's non-static then what's behaviour?
        // Q21. what's the USP of concurrent hashmap.
        // Q22. what's the diff b/w @Secured and @PreAuthorized?
        // Q23. what's the diff b/w Outh and JWT.
        // Q24. you have one complex query, it's already optimized but it's taking time, how you handle it, because it's taking time. analyzation/analysis is fin(perf team) but how you will handle it as it's already optimized.
        // Q25. there was one question for that ans was related to event driven architecture.
        // Q26. you have received too many request, and one of your microservices is down, for examples, MS A is calling MS B and C etc, so lets say B or C is down, so you have so many data, how you will handle, what you do.
        // Q27. rate limit to prevent DDOS
        // Q28. how you will achieve eventual consistency.
        // Q29. we used redis in USBank project, because consistency was not achieved, so without redis how you can achieve and what will you do.
        // Q30.
        // cleared all round. and selected.
